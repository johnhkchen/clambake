MY_LITTLE_SODA_GITHUB_OWNER=your-username
MY_LITTLE_SODA_GITHUB_REPO=your-repo
```

### Setup Your Repository

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Coming Soon)
The `my-little-soda init` command will automate repository setup in a future release:

```bash
# Future: One-command setup (WIP)
./target/release/my-little-soda init
```

**What this will do:**
- ‚úÖ Validate GitHub authentication and permissions
- üè∑Ô∏è  Create required routing labels (`route:ready`, `route:priority-high`, etc.)
- ‚öôÔ∏è  Generate `my-little-soda.toml` configuration 
- ü§ñ Initialize autonomous agent configuration
- üìÅ Create `.my-little-soda/` directory structure
- ‚úÖ Verify setup and test connectivity

#### Option 2: Manual Setup (Current Required Process)
Until `my-little-soda init` is implemented, set up your repository manually:

**1. Create Required GitHub Labels:**
```bash
# Core routing labels
gh label create "route:ready" --color "0052cc" --description "Available for agent assignment"
gh label create "route:ready_to_merge" --color "5319e7" --description "Completed work ready for merge"
gh label create "route:unblocker" --color "d73a4a" --description "Critical system issues"
gh label create "route:review" --color "fbca04" --description "Under review"
gh label create "route:human-only" --color "7057ff" --description "Requires human attention"

# Priority labels  
gh label create "route:priority-low" --color "c2e0c6" --description "Priority: 1"
gh label create "route:priority-medium" --color "f9d71c" --description "Priority: 2"
gh label create "route:priority-high" --color "ff6b6b" --description "Priority: 3"  
gh label create "route:priority-very-high" --color "d73a4a" --description "Priority: 4"
```

**2. Verify Configuration:**
```bash
# Test that my-little-soda can connect to your repository
./target/release/my-little-soda status
```

**3. Start Using My Little Soda:**
```bash
# Label some issues as ready for the agent
gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-label "route:ready"

# Begin agent workflow
./target/release/my-little-soda pop
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Agent Workflow

Start your development session by claiming work:

```bash
# Get your next assigned task (primary command)
./target/release/my-little-soda pop
```

**What this does:**
- Assigns you the highest priority issue
- Creates a dedicated branch (e.g., `agent001/42-fix-bug`)
- Switches you to that branch automatically

### Working on Your Task

Once you have a task, implement your solution:

```bash
# Work in your assigned branch
git add .
git commit -m "Implement feature X"

# Complete your work and create PR
./target/release/my-little-soda bottle
```

**What `land` does:**
- Creates a pull request from your branch
- Marks your work ready for review
- Frees you to work on the next task

### System Monitoring

Check what's happening in your repository:

```bash
# View agent status and task queue
./target/release/my-little-soda status
```

Example output:
```
ü§ñ Agent Status:
  agent001: Working on issue #42 (branch: agent001/42-fix-bug)
  Uptime: 4h 23m | Issues processed: 7 | Average time: 22m
  
üìã Task Queue: 3 issues available
  #45: Add user authentication [priority-high]
  #48: Update documentation [priority-medium]  
  #51: Refactor API client [priority-low]
```

### Preview Next Task

See what work is available without claiming it:

```bash
# Preview the next task you would get
./target/release/my-little-soda peek
```

### Complete Daily Workflow Example

Here's a typical development session:

```bash
# 1. Start your day - get first task
./target/release/my-little-soda pop
# ‚úÖ Assigned issue #42: Fix login bug

# 2. Work on the issue (implement your solution)
# ... write code, tests, etc ...
git add .
git commit -m "Fix login validation bug"

# 3. Submit your work

## Autonomous System Features

My Little Soda provides advanced autonomous operation capabilities designed for unattended, long-running development workflows. These features ensure reliable operation and maintain work continuity even when issues arise.

### üîç State Drift Detection

The autonomous system continuously monitors for **state drift** - discrepancies between expected system state and actual GitHub/workspace state that can occur during long-running operations.

**What State Drift Detection Monitors:**
- **Issue assignments** - Detects if issues are unexpectedly reassigned or closed
- **Branch state** - Monitors for deleted branches or unexpected commits  
- **Pull request status** - Tracks unexpected merges, closes, or review changes
- **Workspace consistency** - Validates local git state matches expectations

**Automatic Correction Strategies:**
```bash
# Minor drifts: Update local expectations to match GitHub
# Moderate drifts: Synchronize state and continue autonomously  
# Critical drifts: Create issue for manual intervention, preserve work
```

**Configuration Example:**
```bash
# Enable drift detection with custom thresholds
export MY_LITTLE_SODA_DRIFT_DETECTION_ENABLED=true
export MY_LITTLE_SODA_DRIFT_VALIDATION_INTERVAL=5  # minutes
export MY_LITTLE_SODA_MAX_COMMITS_BEHIND=10
```

### ‚ö° Error Recovery System

Autonomous error recovery handles various failure scenarios without human intervention:

**Supported Error Types:**
- **Git operations** - Push failures, merge conflicts, authentication issues
- **Build failures** - Compilation errors, dependency issues, test failures  
- **CI/CD failures** - Test timeouts, deployment issues, security scans
- **GitHub API** - Rate limits, connectivity issues, permission changes

**Recovery Strategies:**
- **Automated fixes** - Syntax errors, simple merge conflicts, dependency updates
- **Retry with backoff** - Network timeouts, temporary API failures
- **Escalation** - Complex issues requiring human review

**Example Recovery Scenarios:**
```bash
# Network timeout during git push
# ‚Üí Automatic retry with exponential backoff

# Simple merge conflict in documentation  
# ‚Üí Automatic resolution and re-attempt

# Critical security vulnerability detected
# ‚Üí Create tracking issue, preserve work, escalate
```

### üíæ Work Continuity & Persistence

Ensures work continues seamlessly across agent restarts and system interruptions:

**State Persistence Features:**
- **Automatic checkpoints** - Regular saves of workflow state and progress
- **Crash recovery** - Resume work after unexpected shutdowns  
- **State validation** - Verify workspace consistency after restart
- **Work preservation** - Never lose progress due to system issues

**Checkpoint Configuration:**
```toml
# my-little-soda.toml
[autonomous.persistence]
enable_persistence = true
auto_save_interval_minutes = 5
max_state_history_entries = 100
backup_retention_days = 7
enable_integrity_checks = true
```

**Recovery Actions After Restart:**
- **Continue work** - Resume from exactly where you left off
- **Validate and resync** - Check state consistency before continuing
- **Start fresh** - Begin new work if previous state is too old/invalid

### üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

**Full Autonomous System Configuration:**
```toml
# my-little-soda.toml
[autonomous]
max_work_hours = 8
enable_drift_detection = true
drift_validation_interval_minutes = 10

[autonomous.recovery]
max_recovery_attempts = 3
recovery_timeout_minutes = 30
enable_aggressive_recovery = false

[autonomous.persistence] 
enable_persistence = true
persistence_directory = ".my-little-soda/state"
auto_save_interval_minutes = 5

[autonomous.monitoring]
monitoring_interval_minutes = 5
enable_performance_metrics = true
```

**Environment Variable Overrides:**
```bash
# Core autonomous settings
export MY_LITTLE_SODA_MAX_WORK_HOURS=12
export MY_LITTLE_SODA_ENABLE_DRIFT_DETECTION=true

# Recovery settings  
export MY_LITTLE_SODA_MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS=5
export MY_LITTLE_SODA_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=45

# Persistence settings
export MY_LITTLE_SODA_ENABLE_PERSISTENCE=true
export MY_LITTLE_SODA_AUTO_SAVE_INTERVAL=3
```

### üìä Monitoring & Observability

Track autonomous operation health and performance:

**Status Commands:**
```bash
# Check autonomous system status
./target/release/my-little-soda status --autonomous

# View drift detection report
./target/release/my-little-soda drift-report

# Check error recovery statistics  
./target/release/my-little-soda recovery-report

# Validate work continuity state
./target/release/my-little-soda continuity-status
```

**Key Metrics Monitored:**
- **Drift detection** - Validation frequency, detected drifts, correction success rate
- **Error recovery** - Recovery attempts, success rate, average resolution time
- **Work continuity** - Checkpoint frequency, restart recovery success, state integrity
- **Performance** - Operation throughput, memory usage, processing times

## Troubleshooting Autonomous Operation

### Common State Drift Issues

**Issue:** "Critical drift detected requiring manual intervention"
```bash
# Check what drifts were detected
./target/release/my-little-soda drift-report

# Common causes:
# - Issue was closed while agent was working
# - Work branch was deleted by another user  
# - PR was merged without agent knowledge

# Resolution:
# 1. Review drift details in created GitHub issue
# 2. Decide whether to restore state or start fresh
# 3. Use my-little-soda reset if starting fresh
```

**Issue:** "State validation failed" 
```bash
# Verify workspace consistency
git status
git log --oneline -10

# Check expected vs actual state
./target/release/my-little-soda status --detailed

# Resolution:
# 1. Fix any uncommitted changes or conflicts
# 2. Ensure branch matches expected state
# 3. Run: my-little-soda pop --force-resync
```

### Error Recovery Troubleshooting

**Issue:** "Recovery attempts exhausted"
```bash
# Check recovery history
./target/release/my-little-soda recovery-report

# View detailed error logs
tail -f .my-little-soda/logs/autonomous.log

# Resolution:
# 1. Address root cause shown in recovery report
# 2. Manually fix if automation can't handle
# 3. Reset recovery state: my-little-soda reset --recovery-only
```

**Issue:** "Build failures persist after recovery"
```bash
# Test build manually
cargo build --verbose

# Check if dependencies changed
git diff HEAD~1 Cargo.toml Cargo.lock

# Resolution:
# 1. Fix build issues manually
# 2. Commit fixes: git commit -m "Fix build issues"  
# 3. Continue: my-little-soda bottle
```

### Work Continuity Issues

**Issue:** "Cannot resume work after restart"
```bash
# Check persistence state
ls -la .my-little-soda/state/

# Validate state files
./target/release/my-little-soda continuity-status

# Resolution:
# 1. Check state file permissions
# 2. Verify disk space availability
# 3. If corrupted: my-little-soda reset --state-only
```

**Issue:** "Workspace inconsistencies after restart"
```bash
# Validate workspace state
git status --porcelain
git branch -vv

# Check for uncommitted changes
git diff HEAD

# Resolution:
# 1. Stash uncommitted changes: git stash
# 2. Sync to expected branch: git checkout <expected-branch>
# 3. Resume: my-little-soda pop --validate-workspace
```

### Performance Issues

**Issue:** "Autonomous operations running slowly"
```bash
# Check system resources
df -h .my-little-soda/  # Disk space
ps aux | grep my-little-soda  # CPU usage

# Review performance metrics
./target/release/my-little-soda status --performance

# Resolution:
# 1. Clean old state files: my-little-soda cleanup --old-states
# 2. Reduce monitoring frequency in config
# 3. Disable non-essential features temporarily
