## What Clambake Does

- **ü§ñ Coordinates AI agents** working on different GitHub Issues simultaneously
- **üîÄ Prevents conflicts** with automatic branch isolation for each agent
- **‚ö° Manages workflow** through a 3-phase cycle: Work ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge
- **üëÅÔ∏è Uses GitHub natively** - all coordination visible through labels and PRs

**In simple terms:** Scale your development team with AI assistants that work together like human developers.

## Installation

### Requirements
- **GitHub CLI**: `gh auth login` (for GitHub API access)
- **Git**: Standard git installation
- **Rust**: 1.75+ (for building from source)

### Platform Support

**Supported Operating Systems:**
- **Linux** (x86_64, aarch64)
- **macOS** (Intel and Apple Silicon)  
- **Windows** (Windows 10/11, PowerShell/Command Prompt)

**Platform-Specific Notes:**
- **Windows users:** Use `.\target\release\clambake.exe` instead of `./target/release/clambake`
- **Windows paths:** Commands use backslashes (`\`) for path separators
- **Git behavior:** Cross-platform - same commands work on all operating systems
- **GitHub CLI:** Available on all platforms via package managers

### Option 1: Build from Source

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnhkchen/clambake.git
cd clambake
cargo build --release
```

**Windows (PowerShell/Command Prompt):**
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/johnhkchen/clambake.git
cd clambake
cargo build --release
```

**Executable location:**
- **Unix/Linux/macOS:** `./target/release/clambake`
- **Windows:** `.\target\release\clambake.exe`

### Option 2: Pre-built Binaries
Pre-built binaries are planned for future releases.

### Setup Your Repository
After installation, set up the required GitHub labels:

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./target/release/clambake setup-labels
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
.\target\release\clambake.exe setup-labels
```

> üìñ **Need help?** See the [complete installation guide](docs/README.md#installation) for troubleshooting and advanced configuration.

## Project Status

**Early Alpha** - Not recommended for production use. See [detailed status information](docs/README.md#project-status) for current capabilities and limitations.

## Quick Start

**Already installed?** Here's the essential workflow:

1. **Get a task:** `./target/release/clambake pop`
2. **Work on it:** Make your changes and commit
3. **Submit work:** `./target/release/clambake land`
4. **Repeat:** System automatically assigns next task

See [Usage Examples](#usage-examples) for detailed commands.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Agent Workflow

Start your development session by claiming work:

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Get your next assigned task (primary command)
./target/release/clambake pop
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
# Get your next assigned task (primary command)
.\target\release\clambake.exe pop
```

**What this does:**
- Assigns you the highest priority issue
- Creates a dedicated branch (e.g., `agent001/42-fix-bug`)
- Switches you to that branch automatically

### Working on Your Task

Once you have a task, implement your solution:

```bash
# Work in your assigned branch (same on all platforms)
git add .
git commit -m "Implement feature X"
```

**Complete your work and create PR:**

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./target/release/clambake land
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
.\target\release\clambake.exe land
```

**What `land` does:**
- Creates a pull request from your branch
- Marks your work ready for review
- Frees you to work on the next task

### System Monitoring

Check what's happening in your repository:

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# View agent status and task queue
./target/release/clambake status
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
# View agent status and task queue
.\target\release\clambake.exe status
```

Example output:
```
ü§ñ Agent Status:
  agent001: Working on issue #42 (branch: agent001/42-fix-bug)
  
üìã Task Queue: 3 issues available
  #45: Add user authentication [priority-high]
  #48: Update documentation [priority-medium]  
  #51: Refactor API client [priority-low]
```

### Preview Next Task

See what work is available without claiming it:

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Preview the next task you would get
./target/release/clambake peek
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
# Preview the next task you would get
.\target\release\clambake.exe peek
```

### Complete Daily Workflow Example

Here's a typical development session:

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# 1. Start your day - get first task
./target/release/clambake pop
# ‚úÖ Assigned issue #42: Fix login bug

# 2. Work on the issue (implement your solution)
# ... write code, tests, etc ...
git add .
git commit -m "Fix login validation bug"

# 3. Submit your work
./target/release/clambake land
# ‚úÖ PR created, work submitted for review

# 4. Get next task immediately
./target/release/clambake pop  
# ‚úÖ Assigned issue #45: Add user authentication

# 5. Continue the cycle...
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
REM 1. Start your day - get first task
.\target\release\clambake.exe pop
REM ‚úÖ Assigned issue #42: Fix login bug

REM 2. Work on the issue (implement your solution)
REM ... write code, tests, etc ...
git add .
git commit -m "Fix login validation bug"

REM 3. Submit your work
.\target\release\clambake.exe land
REM ‚úÖ PR created, work submitted for review

REM 4. Get next task immediately
.\target\release\clambake.exe pop  
REM ‚úÖ Assigned issue #45: Add user authentication

REM 5. Continue the cycle...
```

### Administrative Commands

**Initialize a new repository:**

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Set up labels and configuration (run once per repo)
./target/release/clambake init
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
REM Set up labels and configuration (run once per repo)
.\target\release\clambake.exe init
```

**Reset all agents (admin only):**

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Clear all agent assignments
./target/release/clambake reset
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
REM Clear all agent assignments
.\target\release\clambake.exe reset
```

**Bundle multiple PRs for review:**

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Combine completed work into single review bundle
./target/release/clambake bundle
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
REM Combine completed work into single review bundle
.\target\release\clambake.exe bundle
```

### Getting Help

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# See all available commands
./target/release/clambake --help

# Get help for specific command
./target/release/clambake pop --help
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
REM See all available commands
.\target\release\clambake.exe --help

REM Get help for specific command
.\target\release\clambake.exe pop --help
```
