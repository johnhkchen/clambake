# Clambake

**Clambake is a command-line tool that manages multiple AI coding assistants working on your GitHub repository simultaneously.** Think of it as a project manager that assigns coding tasks from your GitHub Issues to AI agents (like Claude Code, ChatGPT Code Interpreter, or GitHub Copilot Workspace), coordinates their work to prevent conflicts, and manages their progress through proper code review cycles.

## The Problem It Solves

Development teams often have backlogs of coding tasks—bug fixes, feature requests, refactoring work—that pile up faster than developers can complete them. While AI coding assistants are getting remarkably capable at implementing solutions, they typically work in isolation, can't coordinate with each other, and often require manual project management.

## What Clambake Does

Clambake turns your GitHub Issues into a managed workflow for AI agents:
- **Task Distribution**: Multiple AI agents can work on different issues simultaneously without conflicts
- **Automatic Coordination**: Each agent gets its own isolated branch, preventing merge conflicts
- **Quality Control**: Built-in code review integration ensures all changes meet quality standards
- **Progress Tracking**: Native GitHub integration means all work is visible through labels, branches, and pull requests
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses only GitHub's existing features—no databases or external services required

**In simple terms:** Clambake lets you scale your development team with AI assistants that work together like human developers—taking on tasks, implementing solutions, and collaborating through proper development workflows.

## Quick Start

Once installed and configured, here's how to get started with Clambake:

### 1. Set up your GitHub repository
First, ensure your repository has the required labels. Use GitHub CLI to create them:
```bash
# Create routing labels
gh label create "route:ready" --description "Issues ready for agent assignment" --color "0e8a16"
gh label create "route:priority-high" --description "High priority tasks" --color "d93f0b"
gh label create "route:priority-medium" --description "Medium priority tasks" --color "fbca04"
gh label create "route:priority-low" --description "Low priority tasks" --color "bfd4f2"

# Create agent labels
gh label create "agent001" --description "Assigned to agent001" --color "1d76db"
gh label create "agent002" --description "Assigned to agent002" --color "1d76db"
```

Expected output:
```
✅ label "route:ready" created  
✅ label "route:priority-high" created
✅ label "route:priority-medium" created
✅ label "route:priority-low" created
✅ label "agent001" created
✅ label "agent002" created
```

### 2. Create a GitHub issue and label it
Create an issue in your repository and add the `route:ready` label to make it available for agent assignment.

### 3. Get your first task
Simulate an AI agent picking up work:
```bash
./target/release/clambake pop
```

```

### 5. Complete the work cycle
After implementing your solution, land your work to create a PR:
```bash
./target/release/clambake land
```

This creates a pull request and frees the agent to pick up the next task.

### Real-World Example Workflow
Here's how Clambake works in practice:

1. **Create issues** with `route:ready` labels
2. **Agents pick up work** with `clambake pop` 
3. **Implement solutions** on isolated branches
4. **Land completed work** with `clambake land` (creates PR)
5. **System routes next task** automatically

The 3-phase workflow (Work → Review → Merge) ensures code quality while maintaining development velocity.

#### Visual Workflow Demonstration
The following example shows a complete agent workflow cycle:

![Agent Workflow Demo](docs/screenshots/agent-workflow-demo.svg)

**Step 1: Agent Claims Task**
```console
$ ./target/release/clambake pop
🎯 Popping next available task...
✅ Successfully popped task:
  📋 Issue #42: Fix authentication bug
  👤 Assigned to: agent001
  🌿 Branch: agent001/42-fix-authentication-bug
```

**Step 2: Agent Implements Solution**
```console
$ git checkout agent001/42-fix-authentication-bug
$ # Make code changes...
$ git add . && git commit -m "Fix authentication validation logic"
```

**Step 3: Agent Lands Work (Creates PR)**
```console
$ ./target/release/clambake land
🚀 Landing completed work...
✅ Pull request created: #123
🎯 Agent freed - ready for next task!
```

## Configuration

Clambake uses a layered configuration system with the following precedence:
1. Environment variables (highest priority)
2. Configuration file (`clambake.toml`)
3. Default values (lowest priority)

### Configuration File Setup
Copy the example configuration and customize it:

```bash
cp clambake.example.toml clambake.toml
```

Key configuration sections:

```toml
[github]
owner = "your-username"
repo = "your-repo"

[github.rate_limit]
requests_per_hour = 5000
burst_capacity = 100

[agents]
max_agents = 4
coordination_timeout_seconds = 300

[observability]
tracing_enabled = true
log_level = "info"
```

### Environment Variable Reference

All configuration options can be overridden with environment variables using the `CLAMBAKE_` prefix:

```bash
# GitHub settings
export CLAMBAKE_GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token"
export CLAMBAKE_GITHUB_OWNER="your-username"
export CLAMBAKE_GITHUB_REPO="your-repo"

# Agent settings
export CLAMBAKE_AGENTS_MAX_AGENTS=8
export CLAMBAKE_AGENTS_COORDINATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=600

# Observability
export CLAMBAKE_OBSERVABILITY_LOG_LEVEL="debug"
export CLAMBAKE_OBSERVABILITY_TRACING_ENABLED=true
```

## AI Agent Coordination Domain

### What Clambake Does
Clambake orchestrates AI coding agents (like Claude Code) to work on GitHub Issues collaboratively. It implements a sophisticated multi-agent coordination system where:

- **Agents** are AI assistants that autonomously complete coding tasks
- **Issues** are routed to available agents based on labels and priorities  
- **Branches** are created automatically for each agent's work to prevent conflicts
- **Coordination** happens through GitHub's native features (labels, PRs, reviews)

### Domain-Specific Setup Requirements

#### GitHub Issue Labels
Your repository must have these labels for the routing system:

**Priority Labels:**
- `route:priority-very-high` - Critical tasks (Priority 4)
- `route:priority-high` - Important tasks (Priority 3) 
- `route:priority-medium` - Standard tasks (Priority 2)
- `route:priority-low` - Nice-to-have tasks (Priority 1)

**Routing Labels:**
- `route:ready` - Issues ready for agent assignment
- `route:land` - Merge-ready work needing final review
- `route:unblocker` - Critical system issues blocking other work

**Agent Assignment Labels:**
- `agent001`, `agent002`, `agent003`, etc. - Track which agent is working on which issue

**Feedback Labels:**
- `coderabbit-feedback` - Issues created from AI code review feedback
- `supertask-decomposition` - Sub-tasks broken down from larger work

Create these labels automatically:
```bash
# After authentication, run:
./target/release/clambake setup-labels
```

#### Agent Workflow Understanding
Agents operate in a **3-phase workflow**:

1. **Phase 1: Work → PR** - Agent implements solution and creates pull request
2. **Phase 2: Review** - CodeRabbit AI reviews the pull request  
3. **Phase 3: Merge** - Agent decomposes feedback into follow-up issues and merges

This prevents work-in-progress from blocking the system while ensuring code quality through automated review cycles.

#### AI Service Integration
While Clambake manages the coordination, the actual AI agents (like Claude Code) need:
- Access to the repository for reading/writing code
- Ability to create commits and branches
- Understanding of the issue requirements and acceptance criteria

The coordination system tracks agent state through GitHub labels, not internal databases, making it transparent and debuggable.

## Advanced Usage

### Multi-Agent Coordination
Run multiple agents simultaneously:
```bash
./target/release/clambake route --agents 3
```

### Monitoring and Management
Check detailed system status:
```bash
./target/release/clambake status --verbose
```

View available work without assignment:
```bash
./target/release/clambake peek
```

## Required GitHub Labels

The labels mentioned in the AI Agent Coordination section are created automatically, but if needed manually:
- `route:ready` - Issues ready for agent assignment  
- `agent001`, `agent002`, etc. - Agent assignments

## Build from Source

For developers or users who need to build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnhkchen/clambake.git
cd clambake
cargo build --release
```

**Platform Requirements:**
- **Linux**: `build-essential` package
- **macOS**: Xcode command line tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools

**Optional**: Add to PATH for global access:
```bash
# Linux/macOS
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"

# Or copy to system location
sudo cp target/release/clambake /usr/local/bin/
```

## Authentication Setup

### Option 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended)
The GitHub CLI provides the most seamless authentication experience:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI (if not already installed)
# On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install gh
# On macOS: brew install gh
# On other systems: see https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Verify authentication
gh auth status
```

### Option 2: Manual Token Setup
If you prefer manual token configuration:

1. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Generate new token with scopes: `repo`, `workflow`, `read:org`, `gist`
   - Copy the token (starts with `ghp_` or `github_pat_`)

2. **Configure the token** using one of these methods:

   **Method A: Environment Variable**
   ```bash
   export CLAMBAKE_GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_personal_access_token_here"
   ```

   **Method B: Credential File**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .clambake/credentials
   echo "ghp_your_personal_access_token_here" > .clambake/credentials/github_token
   ```

   **Method C: Configuration File** (see Configuration section below)

### GitHub Requirements
- **GitHub repository** with Issues enabled
- **GitHub personal access token** with the following scopes:
  - `repo` - Full repository access
  - `workflow` - GitHub Actions (if using automated agents)
  - `read:org` - Organization access (if repository is in an organization)
  - `gist` - For storing agent logs and debugging information

## Repository Configuration

Clambake needs to know which GitHub repository to manage. Configure this in `clambake.toml`:

```toml
[github]
owner = "your-username"        # or organization name
repo = "your-repository-name"
```

Alternatively, use environment variables:
```bash
export GITHUB_OWNER="your-username"
export GITHUB_REPO="your-repository-name"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: `GitHub token not found` error
```bash
# Solution: Verify token configuration
gh auth status

# If not authenticated:
gh auth login

# Or set environment variable:
export CLAMBAKE_GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Or check credential file:
cat .clambake/credentials/github_token
```

**Problem**: `Permission denied` errors
- Ensure your token has `repo`, `workflow`, `read:org`, and `gist` scopes
- For organization repos, you may need additional org-level permissions

### Configuration Issues

**Problem**: `Configuration file not found`
```bash
# Copy and customize the example:
cp clambake.example.toml clambake.toml

# Edit with your repository details:
[github]
owner = "your-username"
repo = "your-repo"
```

**Problem**: Environment variables not taking effect
- Environment variables must use the `CLAMBAKE_` prefix
- Restart your shell after setting variables
- Check precedence: env vars > config file > defaults

### GitHub API Issues

**Problem**: Rate limit exceeded
- Default limit is 5,000 requests/hour for authenticated users
- Configure rate limiting in `clambake.toml`:
```toml
[github.rate_limit]
requests_per_hour = 5000
burst_capacity = 100
```

**Problem**: `Repository not found` errors
- Verify repository name and owner in config
- Ensure your token has access to the repository
- For private repos, token needs appropriate permissions

### Build Issues

**Problem**: Compilation errors
```bash
# Ensure you have the correct Rust version:
rustc --version  # Should be 1.75+

# Clean and rebuild:
cargo clean
cargo build --release
```

**Problem**: Missing system dependencies
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential git

# macOS:
xcode-select --install

# Windows: Install Visual Studio Build Tools
```

### Runtime Issues

**Problem**: No issues found to route
- Check that issues have the `route:ready` label
- Verify repository configuration is correct
- Ensure you have read access to the repository's issues

**Problem**: Branch creation failures
- Verify Git is configured with user name and email:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
