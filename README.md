## Multi-Agent Development That Actually Works

**The Reality**: Claude Code agents enable 8-12 concurrent developers per project, but coordination complexity grows exponentially. Traditional "just code the happy path" approaches fail catastrophically at scale.

**The Solution**: Clambake provides complete GitHub-native orchestration infrastructure so you can focus on building, not managing coordination chaos.

```bash
# Your new multi-agent development workflow
clambake init --agents 8           # Complete setup in seconds
clambake route --priority high     # Intelligent ticket routing
clambake status                    # Real-time progress dashboard
clambake land                      # Safe work integration
```

**What You Get**: Professional-grade multi-agent coordination with zero manual synchronization, built-in observability, and enterprise reliability from day one.

## Get Started in 60 Seconds

```bash
# Install Clambake
cargo install clambake

# Transform any repository into a multi-agent workspace
cd your-project
clambake init --agents 8

# Start orchestrating immediately
clambake route                     # Route tickets to agents
clambake land                      # Integrate completed work
clambake dashboard                 # Monitor all agent activity
```

**That's it.** Clambake handles git worktrees, branch coordination, GitHub integration, and work preservation automatically.

## Why Teams Choose Clambake

### ‚ö° **10x Development Velocity**
Route work to 8-12 concurrent Claude Code agents with intelligent dependency resolution and conflict prevention.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Zero Work Loss Guarantee** 
Battle-tested atomic operations and automatic recovery ensure completed agent work never disappears.

### üéØ **GitHub-Native Integration**
Uses GitHub Issues, Project boards, and PRs as the single source of truth. No custom state files or dual coordination systems.

### üìä **Day-One Observability**
Built-in Arize Phoenix integration provides complete visibility into agent decision-making and performance optimization.

### üîß **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**
Compile-time safety guarantees, comprehensive test coverage, and chaos engineering validation.

## How It Works

### 1. **Intelligent Routing** (`clambake route`)
```bash
clambake route --agents 8 --priority high
```
- Scans GitHub Issues with routing labels
- Assigns work based on agent availability and dependencies
- Creates isolated git worktrees for conflict-free development
- Updates GitHub Project boards automatically

### 2. **Safe Integration** (`clambake land`)
```bash
clambake land --auto-merge --require-ci
```
- Validates agent work completeness
- Creates pull requests with full context
- Waits for CI validation and code review
- Merges to main with automated cleanup

### 3. **Real-Time Monitoring** (`clambake status`)
```bash
clambake status --health-check
```
- Live agent state and progress tracking
- GitHub integration health monitoring
- Performance metrics and bottleneck identification
- Automatic recovery status reporting

### 4. **Automatic Recovery** (`clambake recover`)
```bash
clambake recover --scan-all --auto-pr
```
- Detects orphaned branches with completed work
- Creates recovery PRs for human review
- Prevents work loss during coordination failures
- Maintains complete audit trail

## Real-World Impact

### Before Clambake
```
‚ùå Manual agent coordination
‚ùå Lost work during cleanup
‚ùå Conflicting branches
‚ùå Hours debugging state mismatches
‚ùå No visibility into agent decisions
```

### After Clambake
```
‚úÖ 8-12 agents working concurrently
‚úÖ Zero work loss with automatic recovery
‚úÖ Conflict-free git worktree isolation
‚úÖ 2-second routing, 5-minute integration
‚úÖ Complete observability and metrics
```

## System Requirements

- **Rust 1.75+** - For CLI installation
- **Git 2.30+** - For worktree and branch management  
- **GitHub repository** - With Issues and Projects V2 enabled
- **Docker** (optional) - For Phoenix observability dashboard

## Advanced Configuration

### Multi-Agent Label System
```yaml
# Add these labels to your GitHub repository
- name: "route:ready"     # Ready for agent assignment
- name: "route:review"    # Agent work complete, ready for bundling
- name: "agent001"        # Assigned to specific agent
- name: "human-only"      # Requires human intervention
```

### Project Configuration (`clambake.toml`)
```toml
[github]
owner = "your-org"
repo = "your-repo" 
project_id = 123

[routing]
max_agents = 8
priority_labels = ["high", "medium", "low"]
auto_merge = true

[integration]
require_reviews = true
merge_strategy = "squash"
ci_timeout = "30m"
```
