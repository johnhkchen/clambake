# Clambake

A Rust CLI tool for routing GitHub Issues to AI coding agents using labels and branch management.

**Development Status: Early Alpha**  
This tool is under active development with compilation warnings and incomplete features. Use for experimentation only.

## What It Currently Does

Routes GitHub Issues labeled `route:ready` to available agents by:
- Creating isolated git branches for each assigned issue
- Adding agent labels (e.g., `agent001`) to track assignments
- Managing basic agent state through GitHub Issue labels

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Rust 1.75+** - Required for compilation
- **Git 2.30+** - Required for branch management  
- **GitHub CLI (gh)** - Required for seamless GitHub integration

**Platform Support**: Clambake works on Linux, macOS, and Windows. All core dependencies are cross-platform compatible.

### GitHub Requirements
- **GitHub repository** with Issues enabled
- **GitHub personal access token** with the following scopes:
  - `repo` - Full repository access
  - `workflow` - GitHub Actions (if using automated agents)
  - `read:org` - Organization access (if repository is in an organization)
  - `gist` - For storing agent logs and debugging information

### Authentication Setup

#### Option 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended)
The GitHub CLI provides the most seamless authentication experience:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI (if not already installed)
# On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install gh
# On macOS: brew install gh
# On other systems: see https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Verify authentication
gh auth status
```

#### Option 2: Manual Token Setup
If you prefer manual token configuration:

1. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Generate new token with scopes: `repo`, `workflow`, `read:org`, `gist`
   - Copy the token (starts with `ghp_` or `github_pat_`)

2. **Configure the token** using one of these methods:

   **Method A: Environment Variable**
   ```bash
   export CLAMBAKE_GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_personal_access_token_here"
   ```

   **Method B: Credential File**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .clambake/credentials
   echo "ghp_your_personal_access_token_here" > .clambake/credentials/github_token
   ```

   **Method C: Configuration File** (see Configuration section below)

### Repository Configuration

Clambake needs to know which GitHub repository to manage. Configure this in `clambake.toml`:

```toml
[github]
owner = "your-username"        # or organization name
repo = "your-repository-name"
```

Alternatively, use environment variables:
```bash
export GITHUB_OWNER="your-username"
export GITHUB_REPO="your-repository-name"
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/clambake
cd clambake
cargo build --release
```

## Configuration

Clambake uses a layered configuration system with the following precedence:
1. Environment variables (highest priority)
2. Configuration file (`clambake.toml`)
3. Default values (lowest priority)

### Configuration File Setup
Copy the example configuration and customize it:

```bash
cp clambake.example.toml clambake.toml
```

Key configuration sections:

```toml
[github]
owner = "your-username"
repo = "your-repo"

[github.rate_limit]
requests_per_hour = 5000
burst_capacity = 100

[agents]
max_agents = 4
coordination_timeout_seconds = 300

[observability]
tracing_enabled = true
log_level = "info"
```

### Environment Variable Reference

All configuration options can be overridden with environment variables using the `CLAMBAKE_` prefix:

```bash
# GitHub settings
export CLAMBAKE_GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token"
export CLAMBAKE_GITHUB_OWNER="your-username"
export CLAMBAKE_GITHUB_REPO="your-repo"

# Agent settings
export CLAMBAKE_AGENTS_MAX_AGENTS=8
export CLAMBAKE_AGENTS_COORDINATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=600

# Observability
export CLAMBAKE_OBSERVABILITY_LOG_LEVEL="debug"
export CLAMBAKE_OBSERVABILITY_TRACING_ENABLED=true
```

## AI Agent Coordination Domain

### What Clambake Does
Clambake orchestrates AI coding agents (like Claude Code) to work on GitHub Issues collaboratively. It implements a sophisticated multi-agent coordination system where:

- **Agents** are AI assistants that autonomously complete coding tasks
- **Issues** are routed to available agents based on labels and priorities  
- **Branches** are created automatically for each agent's work to prevent conflicts
- **Coordination** happens through GitHub's native features (labels, PRs, reviews)

### Domain-Specific Setup Requirements

#### GitHub Issue Labels
Your repository must have these labels for the routing system:

**Priority Labels:**
- `route:priority-very-high` - Critical tasks (Priority 4)
- `route:priority-high` - Important tasks (Priority 3) 
- `route:priority-medium` - Standard tasks (Priority 2)
- `route:priority-low` - Nice-to-have tasks (Priority 1)

**Routing Labels:**
- `route:ready` - Issues ready for agent assignment
- `route:land` - Merge-ready work needing final review
- `route:unblocker` - Critical system issues blocking other work

**Agent Assignment Labels:**
- `agent001`, `agent002`, `agent003`, etc. - Track which agent is working on which issue

**Feedback Labels:**
- `coderabbit-feedback` - Issues created from AI code review feedback
- `supertask-decomposition` - Sub-tasks broken down from larger work

Create these labels automatically:
```bash
# After authentication, run:
./target/release/clambake setup-labels
```

#### Agent Workflow Understanding
Agents operate in a **3-phase workflow**:

1. **Phase 1: Work → PR** - Agent implements solution and creates pull request
2. **Phase 2: Review** - CodeRabbit AI reviews the pull request  
3. **Phase 3: Merge** - Agent decomposes feedback into follow-up issues and merges

This prevents work-in-progress from blocking the system while ensuring code quality through automated review cycles.

#### AI Service Integration
While Clambake manages the coordination, the actual AI agents (like Claude Code) need:
- Access to the repository for reading/writing code
- Ability to create commits and branches
- Understanding of the issue requirements and acceptance criteria

The coordination system tracks agent state through GitHub labels, not internal databases, making it transparent and debuggable.

## Basic Usage
```bash
./target/release/clambake route --agents 3
```

Check current status:
```bash
./target/release/clambake status
```

Get next available task:
```bash
./target/release/clambake pop
```

## Required GitHub Labels

The labels mentioned in the AI Agent Coordination section are created automatically, but if needed manually:
- `route:ready` - Issues ready for agent assignment  
- `agent001`, `agent002`, etc. - Agent assignments

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: `GitHub token not found` error
```bash
# Solution: Verify token configuration
gh auth status

# If not authenticated:
gh auth login

# Or set environment variable:
export CLAMBAKE_GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Or check credential file:
cat .clambake/credentials/github_token
```

**Problem**: `Permission denied` errors
- Ensure your token has `repo`, `workflow`, `read:org`, and `gist` scopes
- For organization repos, you may need additional org-level permissions

### Configuration Issues

**Problem**: `Configuration file not found`
```bash
# Copy and customize the example:
cp clambake.example.toml clambake.toml

# Edit with your repository details:
[github]
owner = "your-username"
repo = "your-repo"
```

**Problem**: Environment variables not taking effect
- Environment variables must use the `CLAMBAKE_` prefix
- Restart your shell after setting variables
- Check precedence: env vars > config file > defaults

### GitHub API Issues

**Problem**: Rate limit exceeded
- Default limit is 5,000 requests/hour for authenticated users
- Configure rate limiting in `clambake.toml`:
```toml
[github.rate_limit]
requests_per_hour = 5000
burst_capacity = 100
```

**Problem**: `Repository not found` errors
- Verify repository name and owner in config
- Ensure your token has access to the repository
- For private repos, token needs appropriate permissions

### Build Issues

**Problem**: Compilation errors
```bash
# Ensure you have the correct Rust version:
rustc --version  # Should be 1.75+

# Clean and rebuild:
cargo clean
cargo build --release
```

**Problem**: Missing system dependencies
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential git

# macOS:
xcode-select --install

# Windows: Install Visual Studio Build Tools
```

### Runtime Issues

**Problem**: No issues found to route
- Check that issues have the `route:ready` label
- Verify repository configuration is correct
- Ensure you have read access to the repository's issues

**Problem**: Branch creation failures
- Verify Git is configured with user name and email:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
