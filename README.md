## What Clambake Does

- **ü§ñ Coordinates AI agents** working on different GitHub Issues simultaneously
- **üîÄ Prevents conflicts** with automatic branch isolation for each agent
- **‚ö° Manages workflow** through a 3-phase cycle: Work ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge
- **üëÅÔ∏è Uses GitHub natively** - all coordination visible through labels and PRs

**In simple terms:** Scale your development team with AI assistants that work together like human developers.

## Installation

### Requirements
- **GitHub CLI**: `gh auth login` (for GitHub API access)
- **Git**: Standard git installation
- **Rust**: 1.75+ (for building from source)

### Option 1: Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnhkchen/clambake.git
cd clambake
cargo build --release
```

The executable will be at `./target/release/clambake`.

### Option 2: Pre-built Binaries
Pre-built binaries are planned for future releases.

### Setup Your Repository
After installation, set up the required GitHub labels:
```bash
./target/release/clambake setup-labels
```

> üìñ **Need help?** See the [complete installation guide](docs/README.md#installation) for troubleshooting and advanced configuration.

## Project Status

**Early Alpha** - Not recommended for production use. See [detailed status information](docs/README.md#project-status) for current capabilities and limitations.

## Quick Start

**Already installed?** Jump straight to using Clambake with your GitHub repository.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Agent Workflow

Start your development session by claiming work:

```bash
# Get your next assigned task (primary command)
./target/release/clambake pop
```

This will:
- Assign you the highest priority issue
- Create a dedicated branch (e.g., `agent001/42-fix-bug`)
- Switch you to that branch automatically

### Working on Your Task

Once you have a task, implement your solution:

```bash
# Work in your assigned branch
git add .
git commit -m "Implement feature X"

# Complete your work and create PR
./target/release/clambake land
```

The `land` command:
- Creates a pull request from your branch
- Marks your work ready for review
- Frees you to work on the next task

### System Monitoring

Check what's happening in your repository:

```bash
# View agent status and task queue
./target/release/clambake status
```

Example output:
```
ü§ñ Agent Status:
  agent001: Working on issue #42 (branch: agent001/42-fix-bug)
  
üìã Task Queue: 3 issues available
  #45: Add user authentication [priority-high]
  #48: Update documentation [priority-medium]  
  #51: Refactor API client [priority-low]
```

### Preview Next Task

See what work is available without claiming it:

```bash
# Preview the next task you would get
./target/release/clambake peek
```

### Complete Daily Workflow Example

Here's a typical development session:

```bash
# 1. Start your day - get first task
./target/release/clambake pop
# ‚úÖ Assigned issue #42: Fix login bug

# 2. Work on the issue (implement your solution)
# ... write code, tests, etc ...
git add .
git commit -m "Fix login validation bug"

# 3. Submit your work
./target/release/clambake land
# ‚úÖ PR created, work submitted for review

# 4. Get next task immediately
./target/release/clambake pop  
# ‚úÖ Assigned issue #45: Add user authentication

# 5. Continue the cycle...
```

### Administrative Commands

**Initialize a new repository:**
```bash
# Set up labels and configuration (run once per repo)
./target/release/clambake init
```

**Reset all agents (admin only):**
```bash
# Clear all agent assignments
./target/release/clambake reset
```

**Bundle multiple PRs for review:**
```bash
# Combine completed work into single review bundle
./target/release/clambake bundle
```

### Getting Help

```bash
# See all available commands
./target/release/clambake --help

# Get help for specific command
./target/release/clambake pop --help
```
