Objective\nConnect the route command to real GitHub issues instead of mock tickets.\n\n## Current Status\n- ✅ Agent coordination foundation implemented and tested  \n- ✅ GitHub integration working\n- ❌ Route command shows mock tickets (needs real GitHub issues)\n\n## Requirements\n- [ ] Update route command to use AgentRouter::route_issues_to_agents()\n- [ ] Add real GitHub issue assignment (not just console output)  \n- [ ] Add branch creation for assigned work\n- [ ] Add label-based filtering (route:ready, priority:high, etc.)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- `cargo run -- route --agents 2` routes real GitHub issues to agents\n- Issues are assigned to agents in GitHub\n- Feature branches are created for assigned work\n- All 6 coordination tests pass\n\n## Implementation Approach\nUse TDD approach:\n1. Run failing tests to see what needs to be implemented\n2. Implement minimal code to make one test pass\n3. Move to next failing test\n4. Repeat until all tests pass\n\n## VERBOTEN Rules to Follow\n- GitHub is ONLY source of truth (no local state files)\n- All operations must be atomic\n- Work must be preserved\n- Test everything\n\nConnected to tests in `tests/agent_coordination_test.rs`","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/johnhkchen/clambake/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/johnhkchen/clambake/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
