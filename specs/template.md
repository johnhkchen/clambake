# ARCH-SUPER-X: [Task Name]

> **Template for super task specifications. Copy and customize for each task.**

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- What exists today that needs to change
- Specific pain points and limitations
- Technical debt or architectural issues

### Context
- Why this change is needed now
- How it fits into the broader architectural refactor
- Dependencies from other super tasks

## Target State

### Vision
Clear description of the end goal and desired outcome.

### Success Metrics
- Quantifiable measures of success
- Performance targets
- Quality gates that must be met

### Non-Goals
What this super task explicitly does NOT include to prevent scope creep.

## Interfaces & Contracts

### Data Models
```rust
// Example data structures
struct NewDataModel {
    // Fields and types
}
```

### API Contracts
```rust
// Example trait definitions
trait NewInterface {
    fn required_method(&self) -> Result<()>;
}
```

### Command-Line Interface
```bash
# New or modified CLI commands
clambake new-command --flag value

# Changed behavior in existing commands
clambake existing-command  # now does X instead of Y
```

### Configuration Changes
```yaml
# New configuration options
new_section:
  setting: value
```

## Data Model & Storage

### Schema Changes
- New tables/columns needed
- Migration strategy for existing data
- Indexing and performance considerations

### State Management
- How state is created, read, updated, deleted
- Consistency requirements
- Backup and recovery implications

## Observability & Monitoring

### Metrics
- New metrics to track
- Performance indicators
- Health checks

### Logging
- New log events and levels  
- Structured data requirements
- Retention policies

### Tracing
- Distributed tracing points
- Correlation IDs
- Debug information

## Cutover Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation
- [ ] Prerequisites completed
- [ ] Dependencies verified
- [ ] Rollback plan tested

### Phase 2: Feature Flag Implementation
- [ ] Implementation behind feature flag
- [ ] Testing in isolated environment
- [ ] Performance validation

### Phase 3: Gradual Rollout
- [ ] Internal testing (0% users)
- [ ] Limited rollout (10% users)
- [ ] Full rollout (100% users)

### Phase 4: Cleanup
- [ ] Remove feature flags
- [ ] Clean up old code
- [ ] Update documentation

## Migration Strategy

### Data Migration
- How existing data will be converted
- Validation procedures
- Rollback procedures

### Code Migration
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Deprecation timeline
- Breaking change handling

### User Migration
- Communication plan
- Training requirements
- Support procedures

## Rollback Strategy

### Triggers
When to rollback:
- Performance degradation > X%
- Error rate increase > Y%
- User complaints > Z threshold

### Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Disable feature flag
2. **Short-term**: Revert database changes
3. **Long-term**: Full code rollback if needed

### Recovery
- How to resume forward progress after rollback
- Lessons learned integration
- Re-deployment criteria
