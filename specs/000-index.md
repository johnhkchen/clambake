# Clambake Architectural Refactor - Super Task Index

> **Status tracking for the 9 super tasks in dependency order**

## Overview

This is the master index for the architectural refactor, broken into 9 super tasks that must be completed in order due to dependencies.

## Super Task Timeline

| Task | Name | Status | Est. Time | Dependencies | Issues |
|------|------|---------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **ARCH-SUPER-1** | Specs Directory Foundation | üöß In Progress | 2-3 hours | None | [#136](https://github.com/johnhkchen/clambake/issues/136) |
| **ARCH-SUPER-2** | Core Data & Interfaces Spec | üìã Spec Phase | 4-6 hours | ARCH-SUPER-1 | [#137](https://github.com/johnhkchen/clambake/issues/137) |
| **ARCH-SUPER-3** | SQLite Schema & Migrations | üìã Spec Phase | 6-8 hours | ARCH-SUPER-2 | [#138](https://github.com/johnhkchen/clambake/issues/138) |
| **ARCH-SUPER-4** | Observability & Hourly Rollups | üìã Spec Phase | 4-6 hours | ARCH-SUPER-2 | [#139](https://github.com/johnhkchen/clambake/issues/139) |
| **ARCH-SUPER-5** | Bundler v2 Spec | üìã Spec Phase | 6-8 hours | ARCH-SUPER-3 | [#140](https://github.com/johnhkchen/clambake/issues/140) |
| **ARCH-SUPER-6** | Cutover & Feature Flags | üìã Spec Phase | 4-6 hours | ARCH-SUPER-5 | [#141](https://github.com/johnhkchen/clambake/issues/141) |
| **ARCH-SUPER-7** | Sync, Recover, Doctor Flows | üìã Spec Phase | 6-8 hours | ARCH-SUPER-6 | [#142](https://github.com/johnhkchen/clambake/issues/142) |
| **ARCH-SUPER-8** | Testing & CI Integration | üìã Spec Phase | 4-6 hours | ARCH-SUPER-7 | [#143](https://github.com/johnhkchen/clambake/issues/143) |
| **ARCH-SUPER-9** | Developer Experience & Docs | üìã Spec Phase | 3-4 hours | ARCH-SUPER-8 | [#144](https://github.com/johnhkchen/clambake/issues/144) |

## Status Legend

- üìã **Spec Phase**: Specification needs to be written and approved
- üöß **In Progress**: Work is actively being done
- ‚úÖ **Spec Complete**: Specification approved, ready for implementation  
- üèóÔ∏è **Implementation**: Code implementation in progress
- ‚úÖ **Complete**: Implementation complete and tested

## Dependencies

### Foundation Layer (Must Complete First)
- **ARCH-SUPER-1**: Creates the specs framework for all other tasks

### Core Layer (Parallel After Foundation)
- **ARCH-SUPER-2**: Defines interfaces that ARCH-SUPER-3 and ARCH-SUPER-4 will implement
- **ARCH-SUPER-3**: Database schema (depends on ARCH-SUPER-2 interfaces)
- **ARCH-SUPER-4**: Observability (depends on ARCH-SUPER-2 interfaces)

### Integration Layer (After Core)
- **ARCH-SUPER-5**: Bundler v2 (needs ARCH-SUPER-3 database)
- **ARCH-SUPER-6**: Cutover logic (needs ARCH-SUPER-5 bundler)
- **ARCH-SUPER-7**: Recovery flows (needs ARCH-SUPER-6 cutover)

### Quality Layer (Final)
- **ARCH-SUPER-8**: Testing (validates all previous work)
- **ARCH-SUPER-9**: Documentation (documents all previous work)

## Critical Path

The critical path for the refactor:
1. **ARCH-SUPER-1** ‚Üí **ARCH-SUPER-2** ‚Üí **ARCH-SUPER-3** ‚Üí **ARCH-SUPER-5** ‚Üí **ARCH-SUPER-6** ‚Üí **ARCH-SUPER-7** ‚Üí **ARCH-SUPER-8** ‚Üí **ARCH-SUPER-9**

Parallel work opportunities:
- **ARCH-SUPER-4** can be done in parallel with **ARCH-SUPER-3** (both depend on **ARCH-SUPER-2**)

## Total Estimated Time

- **Specification Phase**: 42-60 hours total
- **Implementation Phase**: TBD (will be estimated in specs)
- **Critical Path**: ~35-49 hours

## Milestone Tracking

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1)
- [ ] ARCH-SUPER-1: Specs framework complete

### Phase 2: Core Architecture (Weeks 2-3)  
- [ ] ARCH-SUPER-2: Interface specifications complete
- [ ] ARCH-SUPER-3: Database schema ready
- [ ] ARCH-SUPER-4: Observability framework ready

### Phase 3: Integration (Weeks 4-5)
- [ ] ARCH-SUPER-5: Bundler v2 specification complete
- [ ] ARCH-SUPER-6: Cutover strategy finalized

### Phase 4: Operations (Week 6)
- [ ] ARCH-SUPER-7: Recovery flows implemented
- [ ] ARCH-SUPER-8: Testing framework complete

### Phase 5: Launch (Week 7)  
- [ ] ARCH-SUPER-9: Documentation and developer experience complete
- [ ] Full architectural refactor launched

## Success Metrics

- All 9 super tasks completed
- No breaking changes to existing workflows
- Performance targets met (see cross-cutting specs)
- 100% test coverage maintained
- Documentation updated and current

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Dependencies**: Blocking issues in critical path
2. **Scope creep**: Features not in original specs
3. **Integration**: Breaking existing functionality
4. **Performance**: New architecture slower than current

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Parallel work where possible to reduce critical path
2. Strict adherence to approved specifications
3. Feature flags for safe rollout
4. Continuous performance monitoring
