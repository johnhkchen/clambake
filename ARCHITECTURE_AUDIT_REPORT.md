# Architecture Audit Report

## Completed Architectural Alignment Review

Successfully audited and updated all existing issues to align with the one-agent-per-repo architectural constraint.

## Issues Updated

### Issue #126 - [EPIC] Migrate Bundling to GitHub Actions & Implement Real Agent Integration
- **Problem**: Contained "multi-agent validation" language
- **Fix**: Updated to "autonomous agent validation" with architectural constraint references
- **Added**: References to Issues #218 (Constraint) and #219 (Value Proposition)

### Issue #182 - [ACTIONS-3] Integrate Real Agents with Bundling
- **Problem**: Referenced "concurrent agents" and "multiple agents"
- **Fix**: Updated to "single autonomous agent per repo" language
- **Added**: Architectural constraint documentation

### Issue #183 - [ACTIONS-4] Add Resource Management and Monitoring
- **Problem**: Mentioned "multiple agents" and coordination
- **Fix**: Reframed for single agent resource management during autonomous operation
- **Added**: Focus on unattended operation monitoring

### Issue #185 - [ACTIONS-6] End-to-End Validation and Performance Testing
- **Problem**: Explicitly mentioned "5+ concurrent real agents"
- **Fix**: Updated to "single autonomous agent works reliably"
- **Added**: Focus on unattended operation stability

## Architectural Compliance Results

✅ **All identified issues updated** - No remaining multi-agent assumptions found
✅ **Consistent language** - All issues now reflect one-agent-per-repo constraint  
✅ **Clear references** - Updated issues link to architectural constraint issues
✅ **Prevention achieved** - Future implementers will see correct architectural guidance

## Related Issues Status
